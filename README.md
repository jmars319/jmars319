# Jason Marshall

Full-stack web developer and systems builder focused on delivering stable, production-ready business software.

I work with small and mid-sized businesses that need systems they can actually run - not fragile prototypes or over-engineered stacks.

**Philosophy:** ship clear systems, reduce ambiguity, and stop when it’s correct.

## How I Work
- Design for real operational use, not demos
- Favor boring, proven tools with predictable failure modes
- Lock releases decisively instead of iterating endlessly
- Treat deployment, data integrity, and safety as first-class concerns

## Technical Focus
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** PHP, Node.js, REST APIs, MySQL
- **Infrastructure & Ops:** Git, Cloudflare, Vercel, GoDaddy, AWS
- **Specialties:** media pipelines, admin tooling, deployment workflows, environment safety

## Active Projects
- **Thunder Road Bar & Grill** — custom site, menu system, media pipeline, admin tools
- **Midway Mobile Storage** — business platform and operational website
- **Midway Music Hall** — large-scale venue system (events, seating, media, admin)

## How to Engage
I take on work in two primary ways:
- **System rebuilds or clean starts** - replacing fragile or unclear setups with a finished, maintainable system
- **Targeted stabilization** - fixing specific failures (media, deployment, admin workflows) and locking the system once it’s correct

Engagements are scoped, shipped, and concluded cleanly. Ongoing support is available when it makes operational sense.
