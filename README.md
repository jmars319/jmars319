# Jason Marshall

Full-stack web developer and systems builder focused on delivering stable, production-ready business software.

I work with small and mid-sized businesses that need systems they can actually run - not fragile prototypes or over-engineered stacks.

**Philosophy:** ship clear systems, reduce ambiguity, and stop when it’s correct.

## How I Work
- Design for real operational use, not demos  
- Favor boring, proven tools with predictable failure modes  
- Lock releases decisively instead of iterating endlessly  
- Treat deployment, data integrity, and safety as first-class concerns  

## Technical Focus
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** PHP, Node.js, REST APIs, MySQL  
- **Infrastructure & Ops:** Git, Cloudflare, Vercel, GoDaddy, AWS  
- **Specialties:** media pipelines, admin tooling, deployment workflows, environment safety  

## Active Projects
- **Thunder Road Bar & Grill** - custom site, menu system, media pipeline, admin tools  
- **Midway Mobile Storage** - business platform and operational website  
- **Midway Music Hall** - large-scale venue system (events, seating, media, admin)  

## How to Engage
I take on work in two primary ways:
- **System rebuilds or clean starts** - replacing fragile or unclear setups with a finished, maintainable system  
- **Targeted stabilization** - fixing specific failures (media, deployment, admin workflows) and locking the system once it’s correct  

Engagements are scoped, shipped, and concluded cleanly. Ongoing support is available when it makes operational sense.
